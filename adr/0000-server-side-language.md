## Considered Options

* {title of option 2}
* {title of option 3}
* … <!-- numbers of options can vary -->

* Bad, because {argument d}
* … <!-- numbers of pros and cons can vary -->

### {title of other option}

{example | description | pointer to more information | …}

## More Information

{You might want to provide additional evidence/confidence for the decision outcome here and/or
 document the team agreement on the decision and/or

 how the decision is validated.
 Links to other decisions and resources might here appear as well.}
