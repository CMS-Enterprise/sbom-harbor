# Overview

This is an opinionated code generator for the SBOM Harbor. Specifically, it is a Cargo Generate template that can be used 
to consistently scaffold code for different implementation patterns.

[Cargo generate](https://cargo-generate.github.io/cargo-generate/index.html) is a developer tool 
that helps you get up and running quickly with a new Rust project by leveraging a pre-existing git 
repository as a template.

It aims to:

- Reduce time to value by automating developer toil
- Codify tribal knowledge and norms
- Provide guidance without mandating strict adherence
- Provide a gentle and structured introduction to programming in Rust by reducing the learning surface required to get started

## Prerequisites

To use this generator you will need to install the following pre-requisites.

- [The Rust Toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
