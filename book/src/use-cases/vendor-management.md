## Vendor Management

While vendors of SaaS and COTS products are expected to generate their own SBOMs, organizations
affected by the Executive Order are still required to collect and store SBOMS they receive from 
vendors. Harbor provides a way to _ingest_, _enrich_, and _track_ vendor supplied SBOMs over time. 
Our current development relative to vendor supplied SBOMs is focused on enabling users within an 
organization that receives SBOMs from vendors to upload them via a user interface. User research is 
underway with vendors to determine what if any automated upload mechanism they would prefer to use.

The scope of the vendor-provided SBOM management feature of Harbor is limited at this time. It may
expand as the research continues, but as of now, the MVP as defined in the roadmap section is 
what is being targeted.
