## Custom Development

The majority of systems at CMS that require SBOM cataloging and monitoring are custom
development projects. Given that, Harbor's roadmap is largely concerned with automatically
generating and ingesting SBOMs for these projects. Once ingested, the enrichment engine operates
on all SBOMs the same regardless of whether a vendor or a development team was the source.
