## Enrichment

Enrichment is the process by which additional metadata about SBOMs is generated and stored.
Examples of _enrichment_ data include:

- Vulnerabilities associated with a package or its dependencies.
- Scores related to vulnerabilities (e.g. EPSS, CVSS) for a package or its dependencies.
- Quality metrics about the SBOM itself (e.g. [sbom-scorecard](https://github.com/eBay/sbom-scorecard) results).
